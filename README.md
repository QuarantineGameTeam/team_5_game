The initial point of this game is that there are three different clans. Every descrete player is a member of one of those clans and has to choose whether to be enemies or friends with two other clans. During the battle clans have to occupy as many checkpoints on the map as it is possible. When the battle is finished there are two winning clans, often cooperating with each other, which have occupied bigger number of checkpoints. Every player also has personal profit depending on his choices.
